    <p><b><h2>Steps to prepare: </h2></b></p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in
             chopped onions and bay leaf; cook and stir until the onion has 
             softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cloves 
             minced garlic, oregano, and 2 teaspoons basil; cook and stir for 2 
             more minutes.</p></li>

        <li><p>Mix in undrained crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes. Bring to a
             boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour. Stir in cinnamon and set 
             pan aside.</p></li>

        <li><p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
             9x13-inch baking dish.</p></li>

        <li><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil, add lasagna noodles and
             bring water to boil again. Cook until noodles are al dente. Drain
              well.</p></li>

        <li><p>Mix together ricotta, eggs, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 2 teaspoons 
            basil, and 1 clove minced garlic.</p></li>

        <li><p>Saute sliced onion and mushrooms in 2 tablespoons olive oil until 
            tender, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and zucchini to the skillet. Cover,
             and cook until spinach is wilted, 2 to 5 minutes. Remove skillet from 
             heat and set aside.</p></li>

        <li><p>Spread 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce in the prepared baking dish. 
            Place a layer of noodles on top of the tomato sauce; spread all of the
             ricotta mixture onto the noodles. Place another layer of noodles on 
             top of the ricotta mixture.</p></li>

        <li><p>Pour about 2 cups tomato sauce onto the noodles; arrange all of the 
            sauteed vegetables on top of the sauce. Top vegetables with noodles and 
            spread the remaining tomato sauce over the final layer of noodles. Top 
            with mozzarella cheese slices and 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese.</p></li>

        <li><p>Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and
             cheese is melted and beginning to brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove
              the lasagna from the oven and let it cool 10 minutes before serving.</p></li>
